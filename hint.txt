Compass:
List is a listing service for all kind of items including movie, music, book, restaurant to help people's capinity. Capinity is a measurement of recognizable information at a time.

Simple over Rich
 -Few critical pages
 -Any actions by scroll
 -Stay minimal though you think you need more
 -High value / tap (One tap does good work)
 -Sequential over Structured
 -No color, just lines that reverage highreso display
Unique over Friendly
 -Experiece without login
Cute over Cool
 -Color pattern from Grant Wood's
 -Use tangible symbols: not "like" but "cherry"
 -Tangle UI to intuitive grasp long list (Metaphor in function, User's eye fliction on edge of UI)

Basic flow and Command:
1. /app/views/users/show.html.erb asks variables (e.g. @user) to 
2. /app/controllers/users_controller.rb. Controller asks data (e.g. @user = User.find_by(:username => params[:username])) to /db/* or /config/routes.rb
3. /config/routes.rb routes requested URL, then return value to the controller
3. /db/* returns value

Database:
migration = create table
seed = structured data (e.g. for test dataset)

Rails Command:
- rails new list -> create new rails app named list
- rails g controller users index show -> create /app/views/users/show.html.erb, /app/views/users/index.html.erb and /app/controllers/users_controller.rb
- rails g model user name:strig username:string location:string about:text -> (create model) generetes migration file

- rake db:create
- rake db:migrate -> create table based on migration file (e.g. /db/migrate/20150117094006_create_users.rb)
- rake db:seed -> insert /db/seeds.rb data to database
- rails s -> run server

- rails detroy model (model name)
- rails g model (model name)

ISSUE:
1. How do we name things?
Tag is a common way to group items. However, a word often groups multiple words (e.g. Banana is a tag to a group of yellow, long, sweet fruit). In addition, Banana is supposed to be a stroke. So, tag and stroke is a kind of word which name things and make the real world recognizable. Names are given when they worthfuly devide multiple things (e.g. "Woman" and "Man" devide 6 billion people into two groups).
